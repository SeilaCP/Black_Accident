## About This Game
This is an **early-stage game** built with **Godot**.  
Right now, itâ€™s more of a **demo** than a fully playable game â€” a peek into my **learning journey** and experimentation with game development.

I plan to continue developing it in my **free time**, adding more features and improvements.  
Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!

## Features (Demo)
- Basic gameplay mechanics
- Simple controls and interactions
- Placeholder graphics and levels
## Planned Updates
- Complete the core gameplay
- Add more levels and challenges
- Improve graphics and animations
- Implement sound effects and music

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
This project is a **personal learning project** in Godot.  
Contributions are welcome in the future once the game is more complete!
